## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6 classes

### Continued development

Sharpening my knowledge of ES6 classes as ES6 classes is one of the ways to achieve prototypal inheritance by abstracting each functionality. This provides more flexibility in writing code without interpolating other member functions.
